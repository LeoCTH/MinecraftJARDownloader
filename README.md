# MinecraftJARDownloader
A Minecraft JAR downloader packed into a single shell executable.

### How to use it?
Command                         | Usage                                                                      |
--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
`./downloader.sh -t b 1.7.10`   | for the MC 1.7.10 client and server JARs,                                  |
`./downloader.sh -t c 1.8.9`    | for the MC 1.8.9 client JAR,                                               |
`./downloader.sh -t c -f 1.8.9` | if you just failed the previous download and wanted to have a clean retry. |

and...  
`./downloader.sh -t s 1.7.10 1.8 1.8.9 1.9 1.9.4 1.10.2 1.11.2 1.12.2 1.13.2 1.14.2`  
... if you are a great server lord/nerd who wants to download all the mainstream versions' server JARs at once.

(but I think you should go for [Sponge](http://www.spongepowered.org/) instead lol)

More detailed instructions can be found using `./downloader.sh -h`.

### Issues
PLEASE report them at the Issue Tracker. **PLEASE**.
Especially for this kind of single file programs, while poorly modularized, is also error-prone too!

Reporting bugs makes my life much easier. Thanks.
